# 🌐 Unit Converter Web App

A simple and interactive unit converter built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
This app converts between **meters ↔ feet**, **liters ↔ gallons**, and **kilograms ↔ pounds** and displays both conversion directions for clarity.

##  Features

- Convert metric to imperial units and vice versa  
- Shows both forward and reverse conversions  
- Clean, responsive UI  
- Prompt-based user input for dynamic conversions

└── script.js        # Conversion logic and UI interaction


## What I Learned

- How to handle **unit conversions** in both directions using JavaScript
- Improved skills in **DOM manipulation** and clean function structuring
- User input handling using `prompt()` and dynamically updating content
- How to avoid **code repetition** using reverse rate logic
- Writing clear, structured **commit messages**
- Creating and formatting a detailed `README.md`


## How to Run the App

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/unit-converter.git
    ````

2. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
3. Click the "Convert" button and enter a number to see the conversions.


##  Possible Future Features
* Add temperature and speed conversions
* Replace hardcoded conversions with dynamic dropdowns
